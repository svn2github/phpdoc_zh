>&#13;   The XML content of <TT

   updated from day to day, and on busy days from hour to
   hour. To follow the updates in the English tree and
   any other language's tree and also participate in
   the discussions, it is highly recommended that you
   subscribe to the <TT

   list. You can subscribe by sending a blank mail to

   Similarly you can unsubscribe by sending a blank mail to

      related to the phpdoc team.

>&#13;      Other senders: the posting to list is not restricted,
      so people not on the list can also post messages. This
      way we got bug reports and suggestions by plain mails
      on the list.

   This long list of mail types can be scaring for someone,
   who can't process the many mails posted to the list. For
   this reason the team is thinking about separating the list
   to language specific list, so commits in the foreign
   languages trees won't posted to the main list. Although
   this is just a plan now.
  </P

>&#13;   If you can't handle the load of this mailing list in
   your mailbox, you can read the messages three ways:
   <P

>&#13;      On the web, in the archives at
      <A

>
     </P

>
     </P

>http://news.php.net/group.php?group=php.doc</A
>
     </P
></LI
></UL
>
  </P
><P
>&#13;   You can also set up some filter on incoming mail messages,
   so you get the most important things, and can participate
   in the discussions while do not need to read big diff
   messages. To ease the filtering the commit messages coming
   from the CVS server, that are larger then 8kb, are put
   into attachements. You can always see the commit message
   and file list in the body, but the diff is in an
   attachement.
  </P

>&#13;   As the Windows HTMLHelp Edition of the manual is evolving
   in an incredible way, there is a separate mailing list for
   CHM related discussions and announcements. You can subscribe
   to this mailing list at <A
HREF="http://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php</A
> using the
   web interface.
  </P
><P
>&#13;   There is also a mailing list named <TT
CLASS="literal"
>php-notes</TT
>.
   You can access it the same way as the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>phpdoc</TT
>
   list (just substitute <TT
CLASS="literal"
>phpdoc</TT
> with
   <TT
CLASS="literal"
>php-notes</TT
>). This list is the place where
   all the manual notes are posted. You may consider subscribing
   to this mailing list if you would like to help manage the notes.
