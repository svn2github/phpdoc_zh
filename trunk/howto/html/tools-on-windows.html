>&#13;    Although the phpdoc environment is based on many Unix
    tools and techniques, there are ways to accomplish the
    same tasks on Windows. It is not too hard to set up a
    Windows working environment with CVS and the DocBook
    tools, but put away your mouse as you will need the
    keyboard for the majority of the tasks! :)

>&#13;     You need the same tools as on Linux. The very basic
     thing is a CVS client. You can find one simple command
     line client here at the <A
HREF="http://ftp.cvshome.org/win32/"
TARGET="_top"
>CVSHome.org</A
>
     Win32 download pool. We do not recommend GUI tools such
     as WinCVS, because they can easily screw up the repository
     with files not intended to be there (eg. files with
     uppercased names). The best is to use one command line
     client, as this way you are in control.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     About XML editors, you are encouraged not to use WYSIWYG XML
     editors, such as XML Spy, because the often friendly auto-indent,
     and optimize features can make the XML files so different from
     the one you started the work with, that the diff posted to our
     <A
HREF="chapter-maillist.html"
>mailing list</A
> and used
     by translators will be useless. Emacs is also available for
     Windows if you would like to give it a try ;)
    </P
><P
>&#13;     If you want to produce something viewable, or just would
     like to test the modified file before committing (recommended!),
     you need some more tools. To get it running on Windows,
     you'll need these tools:

>&#13;     You need to download and install the Cygwin tools. 
     Just select the "Install now!" link and run the supplied
     <TT
CLASS="filename"
>setup.exe</TT
>. It will guide you through
     process of installation. These tools are port of standard
     Unix tools like sed, awk, autoconf, make, perl, ...
     for Windows.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     Run "Cygwin Bash Shell" command from the Programs menu
     (it will be added here by the previous step). Now you get
     a command line which behaves same as bash on Unix boxes.
     If you never worked with bash or Unix before, note that
     there are slashes (/) instead of backslashes (\) in paths.
     If you want to access the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>foo</TT
> directory
     on drive <TT
CLASS="literal"
>c:</TT
> write it as
     <TT

      If you decide to use another directory in one of the next

      We do not give any support if you are self-opinionated :)
      In this situation you can specify the DSSSL location
      manually by using the
      <TT
CLASS="literal"
>--with-dsssl=C:/path/to/dsssl</TT

      option with configure.

     to generate the html versions of the manual, the DSSSL style
     sheets are used by default. If you think you would like
     to test XSL ones, than unzip Norman Walsh's
     XSL files to <TT

>. See

>&#13;     You also need a working copy of PHP 4.x to build the manual.
     On Windows, you should put a <TT
CLASS="filename"
>php.bat</TT
>
     file to the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>phpdoc-tools</TT
> directory, with
     a PHP calling line. You may use the recommended php.ini file
     as the default settings for PHP scripts differ from the ones
     required by phpdoc PHP scripts. Something like this works
     (modify this according to your PHP setup directory):
