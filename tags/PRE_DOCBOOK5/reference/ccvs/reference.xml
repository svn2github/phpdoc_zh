    These functions interface the CCVS API, allowing you to work
    directly with CCVS from your PHP scripts.  CCVS is <ulink
    url="&url.redhat;">RedHat's</ulink> solution to the "middle-man"
    in credit card processing.  It lets you directly address the
    credit card clearing houses via your *nix box and a modem.  Using
    the CCVS module for PHP, you can process credit cards directly
    through CCVS via your PHP Scripts.  The following references will
    outline the process.

   <note>
    <para>
     CCVS has been discontinued by Red Hat and there are no plans
     to issue further keys or support contracts. Those looking for a 
     replacement can consider 
     <ulink url="&url.redhat.mcve;">MCVE by Main Street Softworks</ulink>
     as a potential replacement. It is similar in design and has documented
     PHP support!
    </para>
    <para>
     This extension has been removed from PHP and is no
     longer available as of PHP 4.3.0. If you want to use credit card
     processing features you can use <link linkend="ref.mcve">MCVE</link>
     instead.

    RedHat has discontinued support for CCVS; however, a slightly
    outdated manual is still available at
